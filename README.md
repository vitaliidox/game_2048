# 2048

<br/>

### The goal of this project is to create the game 2048 using the JavaScript programming language. 2048 is a single sliding block puzzle game in which the player combines tiles with the same number to create a tile with twice the value. The goal of the game is to reach a tile with a value of 2048 or as high as possible.

### The project consists of the following elements:

### Game Board: The game board is a grid of squares, initially filled with two randomly placed tiles with a value of 2. The size of the grid can be changed depending on player preference.

### Moving Tiles: When the player moves tiles, they must slide to the end of the grid, combining with any matching tiles along the way.

### Scoring: The game keeps a tally of the player's points, which will increase as the tiles are combined. The score is displayed on the screen.

### End of Game: The game will end if the player fails to make a correct move, i.e. if there are no empty spaces on the grid and no adjacent tiles with the same value.
